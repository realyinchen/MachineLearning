"create a simple card game in which there are 8 cards which are randomly 
chosen from a deck. the first card is shown face up. the game asks the 
player to predict whether the next card in the selection will have a higher 
or lower value than the currently showing card. for example, say the card 
that’s shown is a 3. the player chooses “higher,” and the next card is 
shown. if that card has a higher value, the player is correct. in this 
example, if the player had chosen “lower,” they would have been incorrect. 
if the player guesses correctly, they get 20 points. if they choose 
incorrectly, they lose 15 points. if the next card to be turned over has 
the same value as the previous card, the player is incorrect.",76,294,25.85%,2.67
